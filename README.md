Kanye To The Bot (MarkovBot)
=========

ABOUT
-----
This is a bot which uses MarkovBot and [Kanye West's tweets](http://www.twitter.com/kanyewest) to make a Robot Version of himself tweeting weird obscure things. I thought it was a funny make. If new tweets are generator, it will gather them every hour. This can be modified to use any twitter account, it can only grab the latest 3k tweets though.

INSTALLATION (Tutorial I used).
------------

Read [this post](http://www.pygaze.org/2016/03/how-to-code-twitter-bot/). It'll tell you all about installing this library and its dependencies.

But essentially here are the steps:

1. Install Python 2.7
2. Install pip
3. Add library twitter, and tweepy
4. Make changes to the account you want to imitate
5. Run the *.py script
